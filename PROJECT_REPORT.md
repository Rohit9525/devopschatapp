```

*   **Client (React App):** Handles UI rendering, user interactions, routing, and state management. Communicates directly with Firebase services.
*   **Firebase Authentication:** Manages user sign-up, sign-in, and session management. Provides user identity information (UID).
*   **Firebase Firestore:** Stores application data like user profiles, chat rooms, and messages in a NoSQL document database. Real-time listeners update the UI instantly when data changes.
*   **Firebase Storage:** Used for storing user-uploaded files like profile pictures (if this feature is fully implemented and configured).
*   **Firebase Security Rules:** Define access control for Firestore and Storage, ensuring users can only access authorized data.

## Page 3: Setup and Installation

### 3.1 Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)).
*   **npm:** Node Package Manager (comes bundled with Node.js).
*   **Firebase Account:** A Google account to create and manage Firebase projects ([firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)).
*   **(Optional) Git:** For cloning the repository if obtained from version control.
*   **(Optional) Docker:** For containerizing the application ([docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)).

### 3.2 Installation Steps

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   If using Git: `git clone <repository-url>`
    *   Alternatively, download or copy the project files to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary project dependencies listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies` into the `node_modules` folder.

## Page 4: Configuration

### 4.1 Firebase Project Setup

1.  **Create Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Add Web App:** Within your project, add a new Web application. Firebase will provide you with a configuration object containing API keys and project identifiers.
3.  **Enable Authentication Methods:**
    *   Navigate to the "Authentication" section.
    *   Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
    *   Enable the desired providers (e.g., Email/Password, Google, Facebook). Configure each provider as required (e.g., adding authorized domains for Google).
4.  **Set up Firestore Database:**
    *   Navigate to the "Firestore Database" section.
    *   Create a database. Choose a region.
    *   Start in **Test Mode** for initial development (allows open access). **IMPORTANT:** For production, you MUST configure secure Firestore Rules.
    *   The default rules for test mode are:
        ```rules
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(202X, MM, DD); // Adjust date
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        Replace this with appropriate security rules before production.
5.  **Set up Cloud Storage (Optional):**
    *   Navigate to the "Storage" section.
    *   Click "Get started".
    *   Follow the prompts to create a default storage bucket.
    *   Configure Storage Security Rules similar to Firestore, starting in test mode if necessary and securing before production.

### 4.2 Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to store the Firebase configuration keys.

1.  **Create `.env.local` file:** In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local`.
2.  **Add Firebase Configuration:** Copy the Firebase configuration object provided during the web app setup into this file, prefixing each key with `VITE_`:

    ```dotenv
    # .env.local

    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_..."` placeholders with your actual Firebase project credentials. **Never commit this file to version control.** The `.gitignore` file should already be configured to ignore `.env*.local` files.

## Page 5: Running, Building, and Deployment

### 5.1 Running in Development Mode

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    In the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Access the Application:**
    Vite will start a development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (the exact port might vary). Open this URL in your web browser. The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.

### 5.2 Building for Production

1.  **Run the Build Command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Output:**
    This command uses Vite to bundle and optimize the application for production. The output files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be placed in the `dist` directory in the project root. These static files are ready for deployment.

### 5.3 Deployment Options

The contents of the `dist` folder can be deployed to various hosting platforms:

*   **Static Hosting:** Services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Firebase Hosting are excellent choices. They are optimized for serving static files.
*   **Traditional Web Server:** Configure a web server like Nginx or Apache to serve the files from the `dist` directory. Ensure the server is configured to handle SPA routing (redirecting all non-asset requests to `index.html`).
*   **Docker Container:** Use the provided `Dockerfile` to build an image and run it in a containerized environment (see Page 6).

#### 5.3.1 Firebase Hosting Deployment Example

1.  **Install Firebase CLI:** `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2.  **Login:** `firebase login`
3.  **Initialize Firebase:** `firebase init hosting`
    *   Select your Firebase project.
    *   Specify `dist` as the public directory.
    *   Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all URLs to /index.html): Yes.
    *   Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub: No (or Yes, if desired).
4.  **Build the App:** `npm run build`
5.  **Deploy:** `firebase deploy --only hosting`

## Page 6: Dockerization

Containerizing the application using Docker provides environment consistency and simplifies deployment. The project includes a `Dockerfile` and a `.dockerignore` file.

### 6.1 Dockerfile Overview

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build process:

1.  **Build Stage (`build`):**
    *   Starts from a `node:20-alpine` base image (lightweight Node.js environment).
    *   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
    *   Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
    *   Installs dependencies using `npm ci` (or `npm install`).
    *   Copies the rest of the application source code.
    *   Runs `npm run build` to create the production build in the `/app/dist` directory.
2.  **Production Stage:**
    *   Starts from a lightweight `nginx:stable-alpine` base image.
    *   Copies *only* the built static assets from the `build` stage (`/app/dist`) into Nginx's default web root (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).
    *   Removes the default Nginx configuration.
    *   Adds a custom Nginx configuration (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf`) optimized for serving a Single Page Application (SPA). This configuration ensures that client-side routing works correctly by redirecting all non-file requests to `index.html`. It also includes basic caching headers for static assets.
    *   Exposes port 80 (standard HTTP port).
    *   Sets the default command to run Nginx in the foreground.

### 6.2 .dockerignore File

The `.dockerignore` file prevents unnecessary files and directories (like `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env*`, build output `dist`) from being copied into the Docker build context. This speeds up the build process and reduces the final image size.

### 6.3 Dockerization Steps

1.  **Ensure Docker is Installed and Running:** Verify your Docker installation.
2.  **Navigate to Project Root:** Open your terminal in the project's root directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located).
3.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t blueoceanwhale-chat .
    ```
    *   `docker build`: The command to build an image.
    *   `-t blueoceanwhale-chat`: Tags the image with the name `blueoceanwhale-chat` (you can choose any name).
    *   `.`: Specifies the current directory as the build context (where Docker looks for the `Dockerfile` and application files).
4.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name chat-app blueoceanwhale-chat
    ```
    *   `docker run`: The command to create and start a container from an image.
    *   `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    *   `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 80 inside the container (where Nginx is listening). You can change `8080` to any available port on your host.
    *   `--name chat-app`: Assigns a name (`chat-app`) to the running container for easier management.
    *   `blueoceanwhale-chat`: The name of the image to use.

5.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever host port you chose).

### 6.4 Handling Environment Variables in Docker

The current `Dockerfile` builds the application *without* specific Firebase keys baked in. The React application expects these keys at *runtime* (when the JavaScript runs in the browser).

**Important:** Since the Nginx container only serves static files, the `VITE_` environment variables used during the `npm run build` step are baked into the static JavaScript files. If your Firebase keys are sensitive and you don't want them embedded directly in the built files, you would need a different approach:

*   **Runtime Configuration:** Modify the application to fetch configuration from a dedicated endpoint *after* loading, or inject it via a configuration file mounted into the Nginx container and loaded by `index.html`. This is more complex.
*   **Build-time Variables (Less Secure for Sensitive Keys):** Pass variables during the `docker build` command using `--build-arg`. This still bakes them into the image layer.

For this project's setup, the `VITE_` variables from your development `.env.local` (or system environment) *during the `docker build` process* will be embedded into the production JavaScript files served by Nginx. Ensure the build environment has access to these variables if needed, but be aware of the security implications. The `.env.local` file itself is NOT copied into the image due to `.dockerignore`.

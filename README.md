## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Firebase Project Setup:**

    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    *   Enable Email/Password, Google, and Facebook authentication methods in the Authentication section.
    *   Create a Firestore database in test mode.
    *   Create a Storage bucket.
    *   Obtain your Firebase configuration object from the Firebase Console.

2.  **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at the provided local server URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized build of your application in the `dist` directory.

## Firebase Deployment
